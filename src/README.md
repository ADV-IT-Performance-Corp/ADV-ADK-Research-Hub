# Source Code Examples

This directory contains simple agent examples used for testing and documentation
purposes.

- `sample_agent.py` – toy `EchoAgent` that repeats a message.
- `base_agent.py` – minimal base class shared by other examples.
- `research_agent.py` – stub that returns a short research note.
- `content_agent.py` – stub that returns a generated content snippet.
- `mcp_server.py` – demo orchestrator that routes tasks to the sample agents.

These files are intentionally lightweight to show how agents might interact in
the larger O3 Deep Research system.
