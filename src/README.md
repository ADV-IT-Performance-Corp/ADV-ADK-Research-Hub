# Source Code Examples

This directory contains minimal agent implementations used for documentation and testing.

- `base_agent.py` – shared base class for simple agents
- `sample_agent.py` – toy example that echoes user input
- `research_agent.py` – stub agent that returns placeholder research results

Additional agents can be added following this pattern to experiment with the O3 Deep Research workflow.
