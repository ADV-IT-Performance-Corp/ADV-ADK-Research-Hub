# Analytics Pipeline Overview

This document shows how marketing metrics flow through the system.

1. **GA4 Sync** — `analytics/ga4_sync.py` fetches raw metrics from Google Analytics 4.
2. **BigQuery Sink** — `analytics/bigquery_sink.py` writes KPI results to BigQuery tables.
3. **KPI Reporter** — `analytics/kpi_reporter.py` ties everything together and returns a Markdown summary.

The pipeline lets agents query GA4, compute KPIs and persist them for later analysis.  
Reports generated by `KPIReporter` can be embedded in dashboards or shared with stakeholders.
