# Prompt Observability

This workflow tracks how often prompts are generated by marketing agents. Each
prompt event is logged with a unique identifier and token count. The metrics feed
into the same pipeline that aggregates clicks and conversions so CPC and ROAS can
be compared against content production cost.

1. Agents call `record_prompt()` after creating a prompt.
2. The helper computes token usage and logs via the telemetry client.
3. Aggregated prompt counts allow correlation with paid media KPIs.

Using these metrics alongside ad spend data clarifies how prompt volume impacts
customer acquisition cost and overall return on ad spend.
