# Risk and Drift Mitigation

This document summarizes the key risks identified for the O3 Deep Research system and how the repository mitigates them.

## Prompt Drift

- **Risk**: Prompts may deviate from intended behavior over time.
- **Mitigation**: All prompts are versioned in `docs/meta/prompt_genome.json` and validated through golden prompt tests. ConfigAgent can rollback to a previous prompt version if metrics degrade.

## Token Overload

- **Risk**: Excess context may exceed model limits.
- **Mitigation**: `TokenOptimizer` trims long text. Agents use semantic caching (`SemanticCache`) to avoid repeating content and keep prompts concise.

## Memory Poisoning

- **Risk**: Incorrect or biased data may accumulate in agent memory.
- **Mitigation**: ResearchAgent crossâ€‘checks information with trusted sources. AnalyticsAgent compares assumptions to real metrics. Memory entries include timestamps so stale data can expire.

## Coordination Timeout

- **Risk**: An agent may fail to respond, blocking workflows.
- **Mitigation**: GovernanceAgent monitors heartbeats and triggers retries or escalation if an agent is unresponsive. The system uses an event bus so other agents continue processing.

These practices help maintain reliability as the system scales.
