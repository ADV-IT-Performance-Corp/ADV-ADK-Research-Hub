# GovernanceAgent Concept

The **GovernanceAgent** is a proposed supervisory layer that monitors other agents and enforces compliance rules.

## Purpose
- Track agent heartbeats and trigger alerts on failure
- Escalate anomalies to human strategists
- Enforce policy checks before configuration updates

## Heartbeat Logic (Pseudo)

```python
if not agent_heartbeat.ok:
    escalate("Agent offline: " + agent_name)

```

This agent would integrate with the coordination bus and provide audit logs for all escalations.
