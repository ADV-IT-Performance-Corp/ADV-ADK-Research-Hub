## 🎯 OBJECTIVE

Answer the foundational research question:

> "How should ADV IT Performance Corp. design, develop, and deploy a multi-agent, LLM-powered marketing system optimized for PPC workflows, using Google's ADK, cloud infrastructure, and modern prompt engineering methodologies?"

---

## 📈 GOALS

* Maximize speed-to-deployment and modular reusability of agents
* Ensure semantic intelligence, prompting efficiency, and inter-agent synergy
* Build for extensibility, low latency, and self-improving intelligence

---

## ✅ DELIVERABLE MUST INCLUDE

* Technical architecture of agents + coordination flows
* Development lifecycle: Design → Training → Validation → Deployment
* Semantic memory design, token usage patterns, prompt templates
* Mapping ADK modules to each stage and agent
* Real-world integration patterns on Google Cloud (e.g., Cloud Run, Cloud Functions, AI Studio orchestration)
* Risk & prioritization assessment per subsystem
* Tables, schemas, and structured sections (e.g., JSON, Markdown tables)

❌ Avoid:

* Generic AI summaries
* Chatbot-centric designs that lack orchestration or full lifecycle control

---

## 🔁 META-REFLECTION LOOP (hidden from output)

BEGIN_COT

* Did I maintain alignment across agent purpose, ADK roles, and prompting patterns?
* Where might the system's coordination logic break under fast loop refresh?
* What missing agent type might emerge at scale (e.g., compliance, LLM scoring agent)?
* What trade-offs exist between agent autonomy and centralized meta-control?

## 📦 CI VALIDATION RECOMMENDATION (for Windsurf integration)

To ensure long-term consistency and prevent regressions, create a GitHub CI workflow in `.github/workflows/validate_repo.yml` that includes:

* Markdown linting (`markdownlint-cli2`)
* JSON syntax checks for `source_index.json`, `prompt_genome.json`
* Link health checks
* Required files checker
* Auto-fail on "TODO", "Coming soon", or "placeholder" in any file

> Bonus: Track all changes in `CHANGELOG.md` per semver (e.g., v3.4.0)

This version consolidates recovered logic from all prior prompt versions (V1 → V3), integrated with full source map and reference context expansion.
