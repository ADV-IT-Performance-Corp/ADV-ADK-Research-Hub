## 7. Deployment Architecture (Google Cloud + AI Studio)

This section outlines the cloud-native deployment strategy for the multi-agent system, using Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Vertex AI, and Google AI Studio as the orchestration backbone. The architecture supports modular scalability, agent isolation, low-latency inference, and robust logging for debugging and evolution.

### 🔹 Core Platform Components

| Layer | Component | Role |
|-------|-----------|------|
| **Compute** | Cloud Run / Cloud Functions | Stateless execution of each agent's inference and pipeline tasks |
| **LLM Backend** | Vertex AI + AI Studio | Hosting base models, tuning endpoints, and tool execution |
| **Data Layer** | BigQuery, Firestore | Persistent agent state, campaign logs, historical training material |
| **Orchestration** | AI Studio Flow + Cloud Tasks | Agent coordination, prompt routing, long-running job management |
| **Monitoring** | Cloud Logging + Pub/Sub | Real-time alerts, performance metrics, feedback loop triggers |

### 🔹 Agent Runtime Pattern
Each agent is deployed as a containerized service with prompt-specific configuration. Common invocation paths:

```
→ Request from orchestrator
→ Load agent prompt + memory
→ Inference via Vertex AI endpoint
→ Response logged to BigQuery
→ Feedback loop scheduled (optional)
```

Agents are stateless between runs, but draw from structured memory (Firestore / vector DB / memory_cache.json).

### 🔹 AI Studio Integration
Agents are optionally accessible from a no-code interface via Google AI Studio for:
- Testing prompt iterations (versioned)
- Viewing semantic memory evolution
- Visual orchestration of prompt chains
- Multi-agent parallel simulations (e.g. "campaign + optimization")

### 🔹 Deployment Artifacts

| Artifact | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `Dockerfile` per agent | Language, runtime, dependencies |
| `agent_manifest.yaml` | Defines roles, routes, memory hooks |
| `startup_script.sh` | Used by Cloud Run for init + memory sync |
| `cloudbuild.yaml` | CI/CD steps for each agent |
| `prompt_genome.json` | Maps prompt IDs to runtime + memory specs |
| `orchestration_plan.md` | High-level diagram of invocation & flows |

## 8. Agent Memory, Token Optimization, Feedback Loops

This section details the internal architecture for how agents remember, adapt, and refine their outputs over time — balancing performance with token efficiency, accuracy, and inter-agent interoperability.

### 🔹 Memory Architecture
Each agent maintains a contextual memory layer structured in 3 tiers:

| Memory Tier | Contents | Medium | Purpose |
|-------------|----------|---------|----------|
| **Short-Term** | Recent prompts, responses, scoring logs | In-memory JSON | Supports immediate chaining |
| **Mid-Term** | Performance metrics, campaign snippets | Firestore | Optimizes loop-based adjustment |
| **Long-Term** | Semantic memory embeddings, taxonomy evolution | BigQuery / Vector DB | Aligns to evolving domain intent |

The memory schemas are agent-specific, but interoperable. Cross-agent queries are routed via `semantic_cache.py` and `shared_context_bus()`.

### 🔹 Token Optimization Strategies

| Agent Role | Method Used | Benefit |
|------------|-------------|---------|
| ContentAgent | `token_optimizer.py` on brand snippets | Reduces template bloat in few-shot |
| CampaignAgent | Condensed JSON schemas for UTM trees | Improves parsing + loop call size |
| ConfigAgent | Prompt genome diffs to skip unchanged parts | Efficient test-run cycles |
| ResearchAgent | Embedded lookup tables for trends & taxonomies | Token saving + performance |

Agents self-monitor their token budget and raise an alert when cost or context size exceeds threshold.

### 🔁 Feedback Loop Design

| Loop Type | Agents Using It | Feedback Input | Behavior Triggered |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Self-Reflection | All (especially Content) | Performance scores, tone match | Prompt refinement |
| External Validation | Research, Analytics | Human input, trend mismatch | Memory patch or prompt revision |
| Loop-Based Tuning | Campaign, Optimization | ROAS, CTR, CVR metrics | Weight adjustment, bid strategy shifts |
| Prompt Genome Mutation | ConfigAgent | Prompt version delta, schema diff | Config regeneration |

Each agent is paired with a reflection sub-module (via `self_reflection.py` or `score_aligner`) that updates a memory delta upon execution. All deltas are logged for AnalyticsAgent.

## 9. Inter-Agent Coordination: Messaging, APIs, Shared Context

This section defines the protocols and patterns for agent-to-agent communication, ensuring seamless collaboration while maintaining clear responsibilities and boundaries.

### 🔹 Communication Patterns

| Pattern | Description | Use Case | Implementation |
|---------|-------------|-----------|----------------|
| **Request-Reply** | Direct, synchronous call | ContentAgent → ResearchAgent for data | REST/HTTP |
| **Pub/Sub** | Event-driven, asynchronous | CampaignAgent publishes "campaign_launched" | Cloud Pub/Sub |
| **Broadcast** | One-to-many notification | ConfigAgent updates prompt schema | Cloud Tasks fan-out |
| **Orchestrated** | Centralized flow control | Multi-step campaign creation | AI Studio Workflows |

### 🔹 Shared Context Protocol
Agents exchange structured context objects with these standard fields:

```json
{
  "message_id": "uuid-v4",
  "sender": "agent_name",
  "recipients": ["agent1", "agent2"],
  "timestamp": "ISO-8601",
  "context": {
    "campaign_id": "123",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "memory_hints": ["user_prefs:theme=dark"],
    "content": {
      "type": "text|json|binary",
      "data": {}
    }
  },
  "expects_response": true,
  "response_format": "json_schema|markdown|freeform"
}
```

### 🔹 Error Handling & Retries
- **Transient Failures**: Auto-retry with exponential backoff (Cloud Tasks)
- **Permanent Failures**: Dead-letter queue + human alert
- **Partial Success**: Fallback to degraded mode with monitoring

### 🔹 Performance Considerations
- **Rate Limiting**: Per-agent quotas via Cloud Endpoints
- **Caching**: Semantic cache for common queries
- **Batching**: Group small messages where possible
