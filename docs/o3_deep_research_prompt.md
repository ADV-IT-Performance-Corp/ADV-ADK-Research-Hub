## ðŸ§  META-REFLECTION LOOP (Hidden, but required)

Begin internal COT loop:

```
BEGIN_COT

* What assumptions are brittle or unproven?
* Are any sections overly generic or reliant on static templates?
* Would a future LLM find this modular and composable?
* Are all agent memory and token strategies well defined?
  END_COT
```

---

## ðŸ§© Format & Delivery Notes

- Output must be human-readable **AND** structured enough for downstream LLM processing.
- Use markdown, tables, labeled sections, JSON blocks, code blocks where appropriate.
- Prefer clarity over verbosity. Prioritize composability of each section.
