# 72-Hour PPC Campaign Simulation

## Overview
This document outlines a simulated 72-hour PPC campaign lifecycle to test and validate the multi-agent system's capabilities.

## Simulation Parameters
- **Duration**: 72 hours (3 days)
- **Channels**: Google Ads, Meta Ads, LinkedIn Ads
- **Budget**: $10,000 total
- **Target Regions**: North America, Europe
- **KPIs**: CTR, CPC, Conversion Rate, ROAS

## Hour-by-Hour Breakdown

### Day 1: Launch & Initial Optimization
- **00:00-12:00**: Campaign launch across all channels
- **12:00-18:00**: Initial performance data collection
- **18:00-24:00**: First optimization cycle

### Day 2: Scaling & Refinement
- **00:00-12:00**: Performance analysis and bid adjustments
- **12:00-18:00**: Creative refresh based on engagement metrics
- **18:00-24:00**: Budget reallocation between channels

### Day 3: Maximization & Learning
- **00:00-12:00**: Scale winning segments
- **12:00-18:00**: Final optimizations
- **18:00-24:00**: Performance review and learning extraction

## Example Log Excerpts

```
[Day1 14:00] OptimizationAgent shifted $500 from AdGroupA to AdGroupB (low CTR)
[Day1 18:15] EngagementAgent triggered recovery email sequence
[Day2 09:20] CampaignAgent API error: rate limit hit -> retry in 5m
[Day2 09:25] GovernanceAgent alert: CampaignAgent retry succeeded
[Day3 16:40] ConfigAgent applied schema diff v3.5.2 -> v3.5.3

```

These logs illustrate how agents react to real-time signals and recover from common failures.
