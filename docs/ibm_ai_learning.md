# IBM AI Learning Path â€” Trustworthy AI & Governance

**Source**: https://developer.ibm.com/learningpaths/get-started-artificial-intelligence/

## Overview
IBM provides frameworks for secure, explainable, and auditable AI systems. Topics include MLOps, governance, trust scoring, fairness diagnostics.

## Core Concepts
- AI Governance (OpenScale)
- Explainability (XAI pipelines)
- Model drift detection
- Compliance enforcement
- AI ethics and bias mitigation
- Model monitoring and validation

## Agent Applications
| Agent         | Feature               | IBM Tool/Concept         | Implementation Notes |
|---------------|----------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|
| CampaignAgent | Risk-aware targeting | IBM AI OpenScale alerts | Monitor model drift in real-time |
| RiskAgent     | Bias detection       | AI Fairness 360         | Pre-deployment bias checks |
| AuditAgent    | Compliance tracking  | Watson OpenPages        | Automated compliance reporting |

## Integration with ADK
- Use `base_agent` with IBM's AIF360 for fairness-aware training
- Implement `semantic_cache` for governance documentation retrieval
- Add monitoring hooks for model performance metrics

## Best Practices
1. Regular bias audits using AIF360
2. Continuous monitoring with OpenScale
3. Automated documentation with Watson Knowledge Catalog
