# GovernanceAgent Concept

The **GovernanceAgent** is a proposed supervisory layer that monitors agent activity, enforces compliance rules, and handles escalation scenarios.

## Key Functions
- Send periodic heartbeats to confirm agent health
- Retry failed tasks or trigger fallback routines
- Escalate policy violations to human strategists
- Maintain an audit log for all critical actions

Integration of this agent will strengthen reliability and provide a clear mechanism for recovery during simulation failures.
For implementation guidance see the [O3 Integration Guide](integration_guide_o3.md).
