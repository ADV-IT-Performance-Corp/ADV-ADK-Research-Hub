# ROAS-Driven Budget Allocation

**Source**: Internal methodology
**Focus**: Allocate spend using return on ad spend goals

## Key Steps

1. Gather historical metrics per channel using `MetricsCollector`.
2. Calculate recommended spend based on target ROAS or CPA.
3. Distribute budget toward channels exceeding goal performance.
4. Divide total allocation by 30 to set a daily budget benchmark.

This approach keeps spend aligned with profitability while reacting to channel-level results.
