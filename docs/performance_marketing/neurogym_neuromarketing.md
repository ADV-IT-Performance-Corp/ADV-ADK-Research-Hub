**Source**: https://www.myneurogym.com/  
**Founder**: John Assaraf  
**Focus**: Behavior-driven marketing, cognitive triggers, motivation psychology

## Core Principles

### 1. Innercise Protocols
Mental priming techniques that remove internal resistance.
- Agent Use: EngagementAgent onboarding flows
- Prompt Hook: "Why now? What's in it for you?"

### 2. Brain-Trigger Messaging
Phrases that activate attention, emotion, and decision-making.
- Prompt Layering: "Imagine if... → Now feel... → Act now..."

### 3. Reticular Activation
Focus on salient words, outcomes, and visuals that match intent.
- Application: dynamic prompt generation for headlines & CTAs

### 4. Fear + Vision Duality
Use both pain-avoidance and aspirational framing in prompt design.
