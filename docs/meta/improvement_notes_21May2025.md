# Improvement Notes – 21 May 2025 Doc Review

This note compares the `O3 Deep Research Prompt – V3.5 Unified Final` dated 2025-05-21 with the current repository state (v3.5.3). The goal is to retain strengths from the earlier version while further optimizing the repo.

## Key Strengths to Preserve
- Full lifecycle coverage from research to deployment in the prompt kernel.
- Detailed agent mapping with memory, feedback loops, and coordination protocols.
- Structured tables for agent roles and prompt patterns.
- Emphasis on CI validation and prompt genome metadata.

## Opportunities for Enhancement
1. **Version Tracking**
   - Integrate explicit release metadata for subversions (v3.5.1–v3.5.3) in `prompt_evolution_log/v3.5.yaml`.
   - Document changes between minor versions similar to `version_diff_v3.4.1_to_v3.5.0.md`.

2. **Simulation Coverage**
   - Expand the 72‑hour PPC lifecycle simulation with timestamped log examples.
   - Include failure scenarios and recovery steps for each agent.

3. **Inter‑Agent Governance**
   - Add a future `GovernanceAgent` concept to manage compliance and escalation.
   - Define retry logic and heartbeat checks in the coordination layer.

4. **Prompt Mutation Testing**
   - Enhance `ConfigAgent` documentation with example schema diffs and test cases.
   - Create additional golden prompts focusing on configuration adjustments.

5. **Documentation Clarity**
   - Cross‑link related docs (e.g., `integration_guide_o3.md`) from `prompt_kernel_v3.5.md` sections.
   - Summarize key diagrams from the 21 May version in `agent_system_overview.md`.

These proposals aim to keep all existing content while incrementally refining documentation, testing, and agent coordination.
